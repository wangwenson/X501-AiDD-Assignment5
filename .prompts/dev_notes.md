AI Response: What I added
index.html — Homepage with intro and consistent navigation.
about.html — Detailed biography and a profile image (placeholder) in images.
resume.html — HTML-formatted resume template (education, experience, skills, achievements).
projects.html — Two project entries with placeholder screenshots and links.
contact.html — Contact info and a contact form scaffold (non-functional action="#").
styles.css — Shared styles for consistent layout and navigation.
images/profile-placeholder.svg, project1-placeholder.svg, project2-placeholder.svg — lightweight SVG placeholders you can replace with real images.
Next steps you might want

Replace placeholder text and links with your real content.
Put your real profile photo in images and update the src in about.html.
Optionally add a PDF resume in the project root and link it from resume.html.
Hook the contact form to a backend or service (Step 4) — I can scaffold a simple Netlify/Formspree setup if you want.
Run a local server to preview (I can provide PowerShell commands and/or start one for you).

I accepted all the files and code that Copilot generated.

Prompt: Utilizing the color palettes #000000, #b9baa3, #d6d5c9, #a22c29, #902923, adjust the css to align reflect the color palette. Edit the layout of the htmls to look more professional.

I'm going to update styles.css to apply your color palette and improve typography, layout, and component styles so the site looks more professional and portfolio-ready. Expected outcome: updated variables and styles (header, nav, hero, cards, forms, buttons, project grid, responsive rules). I'll apply a single patch to replace the CSS file.

styles.css+71-18
Done — I updated styles.css to use your palette (#000000, #b9baa3, #d6d5c9, #a22c29, #902923) and gave the site a more professional, consistent portfolio look.

What changed (high-level)

Replaced CSS variables with the provided colors and semantic names (--black, --muted-olive, --paper, --accent, --accent-dark).
Improved typography, spacing, and responsive layout.
Styled header/navigation with better hover states.
Added card-style project containers, subtle shadows, and rounded corners.
Polished forms and buttons with focus/hover states.

I kept most of it, but had Copilot adjust the background colors and text colors since they were not readable.

Reflection: AI messed up the formatting part by making the text blend into the background.
