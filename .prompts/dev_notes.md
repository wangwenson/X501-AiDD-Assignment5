AI Response: What I added
index.html — Homepage with intro and consistent navigation.
about.html — Detailed biography and a profile image (placeholder) in images.
resume.html — HTML-formatted resume template (education, experience, skills, achievements).
projects.html — Two project entries with placeholder screenshots and links.
contact.html — Contact info and a contact form scaffold (non-functional action="#").
styles.css — Shared styles for consistent layout and navigation.
images/profile-placeholder.svg, project1-placeholder.svg, project2-placeholder.svg — lightweight SVG placeholders you can replace with real images.
Next steps you might want

Replace placeholder text and links with your real content.
Put your real profile photo in images and update the src in about.html.
Optionally add a PDF resume in the project root and link it from resume.html.
Hook the contact form to a backend or service (Step 4) — I can scaffold a simple Netlify/Formspree setup if you want.
Run a local server to preview (I can provide PowerShell commands and/or start one for you).

I accepted all the files and code that Copilot generated.

Prompt: Utilizing the color palettes #000000, #b9baa3, #d6d5c9, #a22c29, #902923, adjust the css to align reflect the color palette. Edit the layout of the htmls to look more professional.

I'm going to update styles.css to apply your color palette and improve typography, layout, and component styles so the site looks more professional and portfolio-ready. Expected outcome: updated variables and styles (header, nav, hero, cards, forms, buttons, project grid, responsive rules). I'll apply a single patch to replace the CSS file.

styles.css+71-18
Done — I updated styles.css to use your palette (#000000, #b9baa3, #d6d5c9, #a22c29, #902923) and gave the site a more professional, consistent portfolio look.

What changed (high-level)

Replaced CSS variables with the provided colors and semantic names (--black, --muted-olive, --paper, --accent, --accent-dark).
Improved typography, spacing, and responsive layout.
Styled header/navigation with better hover states.
Added card-style project containers, subtle shadows, and rounded corners.
Polished forms and buttons with focus/hover states.

I kept most of it, but had Copilot adjust the background colors and text colors since they were not readable.

Prompt: Break the content in the about and projects pages into their own cards based on the heading/project. Make sure that the formatting is consistent across the website.

I'll convert the three About cards into a horizontal scrolling row for all screen sizes by updating about.html to use a .cards-horizontal container and adding CSS to style it.
Converted the three sections into a horizontal card row with smooth scroll on small screens and equal-width cards on desktop.
Added .cards-horizontal styles in css/styles.css.
Kept the enlarged, top-centered profile image.
Want arrows for snapping between cards, or should we keep it purely swipe/scroll?

I kept the color and font changes, but Copilot split the sections into columns instead of horizontal rows. This required additional prompting to resolve.

Reflection: I found that overall, the speed of creating a simple website is much faster with AI than without. AI is very good at generating basic boilerplate code, such as the navbar, setting up containers in main, and having the footer. It can also quickly address moving things around when changes are needed. The main struggle AI has is actually in the overall design choice and palette. While it can adjust the website's formatting, it lacks the ability to determine whether or not it would fit the theme of the website. Even when I provided a color palette, the AI would misuse it by having the font color blend into the background, which would require more prompting to fix. There were also some issues like generating columns instead of horizontal containers. However, with iterative prompting or a more specific prompt to start, it can handle all the styles easily. My coding came in specifically for content, such as the foramtting of headers and body text. Overall, AI was quite good at building basic boilerplate and fixing formatting, but it needs clear guidelines on what to change.
